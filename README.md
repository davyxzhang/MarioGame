# MarioGame
Simple game with background and mario sprites;
This involved:
  - Creating a frame
  - Setting the display
  - Creating automatic sprite movements (movie loops)
  - Creating listeners for keyboard buttons to move sprite
  - Checking for collision with enemy sprites
  - Checking for edge of screen
  - Simple score based on time

Developed in Eclipse IDE--will package it up once it's been finalized.
